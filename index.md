## Welcome to Web-development

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Rodesh-webdeveloper/homepage/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Rodesh-webdeveloper/homepage/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

<h3>Tag Question</h3>
<b>Remember things  while learning tag-question.</b>
<pre>
  1) The structure of the tag question is 'common + auxilibary verb +subject + quesetion marks'.
  2) Use a common to spearate the statement and the tag qusetion.
  3) End the tag question with a question mark.
  4) Use the contracted forms of negative auxiliaries (isn't, hasn't, wasn't, weren't, ...).
  5) Use the same auxiliary verb.
  6) Use "don't/didn't/doesn't" if there is no auxiliary.
  7) The subjec should agree with auxiliary verb.
  8) Always use single pronouns. Do not use nouns as the subject of the tag.
  9) Use only nine pronouns (I, we, you, he, she, it ,thery, there, one).
